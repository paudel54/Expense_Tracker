In React, the /:id syntax is commonly used in the context of routing and URL parameters. It is a placeholder that captures a dynamic value from the URL and passes it as a parameter to a React component.

When you define a route with /:id in your React application, it means that the URL can have a variable segment after the slash (/). This segment can be any value, and it will be captured and made available as a parameter named id in the component that is rendered for that route.
